# Overview
- This Project is an Exploratory Data Analysis conducted on the TMDb dataset (a subset of IMDb dataset on Kaggle) provided via UdacityData Analyst NanoDegree [DAND] Resources.
- It contains 2 CSV files with the cleaned data used for the data analysis. Data cleaning steps performed are mentioned in the .pynb files
- Investigate_a_Dataset and Investigate_a_Dataset_TMDb are the initial passes of EDA used to formulate the Questions to be answered by detailed investigation.
- Investigate_a_Dataset_TMDb_NirupamaPV.pynb is the final submission for Udacityâ€™s DAND third assignment.
- Investigate_a_Dataset_TMDb_Directors_NirupamaPV.pynb is my own EDA to see the dataset with an angle of Directorial Influence over movies, ratings and revenues.
- .pynb files contain Markdowns (Git flavor) to explain steps and rationale of the analysis performed
